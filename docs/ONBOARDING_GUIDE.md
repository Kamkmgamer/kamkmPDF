```

## Testing & Development

### Reset Onboarding for Testing

To see the onboarding again during development:

1. **Via Browser Console**:

   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem("onboardingCompleted");
   // Then refresh the page
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Via Browser DevTools**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)

   - Find Local Storage
   - Delete the `onboardingCompleted` key
   - Refresh the page

3. **Clear All Site Data**:
   - Open DevTools
   - Application ‚Üí Clear Storage
   - Click "Clear site data"

### Show Onboarding to All Users

To temporarily show onboarding to all users (for testing/updates), modify the localStorage check in `Onboarding.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change from:
const onboardingCompleted = localStorage.getItem("onboardingCompleted");

// To (force show):
const onboardingCompleted = false;
```

## Customization

### Modify Steps

Edit the `steps` array in `src/_components/Onboarding.tsx`:

```typescript
const steps: OnboardingStep[] = [
  {
    id: 0,
    icon: <YourIcon className="h-12 w-12" />,
    title: "Your Title",
    description: "Your description text",
    gradient: "from-blue-500 via-cyan-500 to-sky-500",
  },
  // Add more steps...
];
```

### Change Colors

Update the gradient classes in the steps array. Available gradients (matching app theme):

- `from-blue-500 via-cyan-500 to-sky-500`
- `from-sky-500 via-blue-500 to-indigo-500`
- `from-indigo-500 via-blue-500 to-cyan-500`
- `from-cyan-500 via-sky-500 to-blue-500`

### Adjust Animation Speed

Modify transition durations in the component:

```typescript
// Fade in/out speed
transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}

// Icon animation
transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 200, damping: 15 }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Onboarding doesn't show

- Check if `onboardingCompleted` exists in localStorage
- Ensure user is signed in (onboarding only shows on dashboard)
- Check browser console for errors

### Onboarding shows every time

- Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
- Check for incognito/private mode (localStorage doesn't persist)
- Ensure the completion handler is being called

### Animation issues

- Check if user has "Reduce motion" enabled in OS settings
- Framer Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion` automatically
- Verify Framer Motion is installed: `npm list framer-motion`
