### Guest post pitch

Subject: Guest post on AI PDF automation for [Site]

Hi [Name],

We'd love to contribute a non-promotional, technically detailed article for [Site]. Here are 3 topics we can deliver in 1–2 weeks:

- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

Example writing sample: [link]
We can include a code repo and diagrams. Open to your editorial guidance and canonical settings.

Thanks,
Team kamkmPDF

### Integration co-marketing

Subject: Integration guide: [Library] + kamkmPDF

Hi [Name],

We can build a sample repo and step-by-step guide that shows how to generate PDFs with [Library] and kamkmPDF. We'll host the repo and cross-link to your docs, and we'd love a mention in your integrations page.

Timeline: 1–2 weeks. Happy to coordinate on review.

Thanks,
Team kamkmPDF
