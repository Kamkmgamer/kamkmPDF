## ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY

### 2. Rate Limiting Implementation

#### 2.1 Install Dependencies

- [ ] Install `@upstash/ratelimit`
- [ ] Install `@upstash/redis` (or use existing Redis)
- [ ] Add Redis URL to environment variables

#### 2.2 Create Rate Limiting Utility

- [ ] Create `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
- [ ] Configure rate limits for PDF generation (10 per minute)
- [ ] Configure rate limits for API calls (100 per minute)
- [ ] Configure rate limits for file uploads (20 per minute)
- [ ] Configure rate limits for job creation (30 per minute)
- [ ] Add different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated users
- [ ] Add tier-based rate limits (higher limits for paid tiers)

#### 2.3 Apply Rate Limiting to Routes

- [ ] Add rate limiting to `/api/jobs/create-with-image`
- [ ] Add rate limiting to `/api/v1/generate`
- [ ] Add rate limiting to tRPC `jobs.create` mutation
- [ ] Add rate limiting to file upload endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting to API key endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting to subscription endpoints

#### 2.4 Error Handling

- [ ] Return proper 429 status codes
- [ ] Include retry-after headers
- [ ] Show user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Log rate limit violations for monitoring

#### 2.5 Testing

- [ ] Test rate limiting works correctly
- [ ] Test rate limits reset after time window
- [ ] Test different limits for different tiers
- [ ] Test rate limiting doesn't affect authenticated users incorrectly

### 4. Security Headers

#### 4.1 Configure Security Headers in Next.js

- [ ] Add `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header
- [ ] Add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
- [ ] Add `X-XSS-Protection` header
- [ ] Add `Referrer-Policy` header
- [ ] Add `Permissions-Policy` header

- [ ] Configure headers in `next.config.js`

#### 4.2 CSP Configuration

- [ ] Whitelist necessary domains (fonts, images)
- [ ] Allow inline styles for PDF generation
- [ ] Configure nonce for scripts
- [ ] Test CSP doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Document CSP exceptions

#### 4.3 Testing

- [ ] Test security headers are present
- [ ] Test CSP doesn't block legitimate resources
- [ ] Use security headers checker (securityheaders.com)
- [ ] Verify headers in production

- [ ] Add virus scanning for uploads (optional)

#### 9.3 Testing

- [ ] Test prompt injection prevention
- [ ] Test XSS prevention
- [ ] Test file upload validation
- [ ] Test input length limits
