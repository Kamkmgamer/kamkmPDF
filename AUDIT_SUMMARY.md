## Critical Issues

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps (Fix Immediately)

#### 1. **Insufficient Testing (3/10)** üî¥

**Severity: HIGH | Impact: Critical**

- Only **3 test files** found in entire codebase
- No integration tests for critical flows
- No E2E tests for user journeys
- No test coverage reporting

**Risk:** High probability of regressions, difficult to refactor with confidence.

**Recommended Action:** Implement comprehensive testing strategy (see TODO.md section 1)

---

#### 2. **Missing Rate Limiting** üî¥

**Severity: HIGH | Impact: Security Risk**

- No rate limiting on public API endpoints
- Vulnerable to DDoS and abuse
- Unauthenticated users can spam PDF generation

**Risk:** Service abuse, cost overruns, degraded performance.

**Recommended Action:** Implement rate limiting with Upstash Redis (see TODO.md section 2)

---

#### 3. **Browser Pool Memory Management** üî¥

**Severity: HIGH | Impact: Stability Risk**

- No memory monitoring for Puppeteer instances
- No automatic browser restart on memory limits
- Risk of memory exhaustion under load

**Risk:** Application crashes, OOM errors, degraded performance.

**Recommended Action:** Add memory monitoring and lifecycle management (see TODO.md section 3)

---

#### 4. **Missing Security Headers** üü°

**Severity: MEDIUM | Impact: Security Risk**

- No Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Vulnerable to XSS and clickjacking

**Risk:** Security vulnerabilities, compliance issues.

**Recommended Action:** Configure security headers in Next.js config (see TODO.md section 4)

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Improvements Needed

#### 5. **Limited Monitoring & Observability** üü°

- No error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
- No structured logging (using console.log)
- No performance monitoring
- No business metrics tracking

**Impact:** Difficult to detect and diagnose issues in production.

**Recommended Action:** Set up monitoring stack (see TODO.md section 5)

#### 6. **Large Component Files** üü°

- `page.tsx` has 950 lines
- `dashboard/page.tsx` has 201 lines
- Difficult to maintain and test

**Impact:** Reduced maintainability, harder code reviews.

**Recommended Action:** Refactor into smaller components (see TODO.md section 6)

#### 7. **Missing Service Layer** üü°

- Business logic mixed with API routes
- Difficult to test business logic in isolation
- Tight coupling between layers

**Impact:** Reduced testability, harder to maintain.

**Recommended Action:** Implement service layer pattern (see TODO.md section 7)

#### 8. **No API Documentation** üü°

- No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Difficult for developers to integrate
- No API versioning strategy

**Impact:** Poor developer experience, integration challenges.

**Recommended Action:** Generate API documentation (see TODO.md section 8)
