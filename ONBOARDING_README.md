## 🧪 Testing

### To See the Onboarding Again:

**Option 1: Browser Console** (Fastest)

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("onboardingCompleted");
location.reload();
```

**Option 2: DevTools**

1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Find **Local Storage** → your domain
4. Delete the `onboardingCompleted` key
5. Refresh the page

**Option 3: Use the Settings Component** (Optional)

- Add `<OnboardingSettings />` to your settings page
- Click "Show Tutorial Again" button

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Steps Content

Edit `src/_components/Onboarding.tsx`:

```typescript
const steps: OnboardingStep[] = [
  {
    id: 0,
    icon: <YourIcon className="h-12 w-12" />,
    title: "Your Custom Title",
    description: "Your custom description",
    gradient: "from-blue-500 via-cyan-500 to-sky-500",
  },
  // Add or modify steps...
];
```

### Add/Remove Steps

Simply add or remove objects from the `steps` array. The component automatically:

- Updates progress dots
- Adjusts step navigation
- Handles the "last step" state

### Change Colors

Use these gradient classes (matching your app theme):

- `from-blue-500 via-cyan-500 to-sky-500`
- `from-sky-500 via-blue-500 to-indigo-500`
- `from-indigo-500 via-blue-500 to-cyan-500`
- `from-cyan-500 via-sky-500 to-blue-500`

## 📱 Where It Shows

The onboarding appears on: **Dashboard Page** (`/dashboard`)

When a user:

1. Signs in for the first time
2. Visits the dashboard
3. Hasn't completed the onboarding before

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Main Dashboard

Already integrated! File: `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`

### Settings Page (Optional)

Add to your settings page:

```tsx
import OnboardingSettings from "~/_components/OnboardingSettings";

export default function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Settings</h1>
      <OnboardingSettings />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Programmatic Control

Use the hook anywhere:

```tsx
import { useOnboarding } from "~/_components/hooks/useOnboarding";

function MyComponent() {
  const { hasCompleted, resetOnboarding } = useOnboarding();

  return <button onClick={resetOnboarding}>Show Tutorial</button>;
}
```

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

1. **localStorage**: Persists completion state across sessions
2. **Auto-trigger**: Shows automatically, no manual trigger needed
3. **Skip-friendly**: Users can skip at any step
4. **Lightweight**: Uses existing dependencies (Framer Motion)
5. **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, reduced motion support

## 📊 Performance

- ✅ Lazy loaded (only renders when visible)
- ✅ GPU-accelerated animations
- ✅ Optimized re-renders
- ✅ No layout thrashing

## 🌐 Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest 2 versions) ✅
- Firefox (latest 2 versions) ✅
- Safari (latest 2 versions) ✅
- Mobile browsers ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Onboarding not showing?**

- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem("onboardingCompleted")`
- Check if you're on `/dashboard` route
- Ensure you're signed in

**Shows every time?**

- Check if localStorage is enabled
- Not in incognito/private mode
- Completion handler is being called

**Animation issues?**

- Check for "Reduce motion" in OS settings
- Verify Framer Motion is installed
