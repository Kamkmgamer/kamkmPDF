## üìù Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] **Same Prompt Regeneration**
  - [ ] Open existing PDF
  - [ ] Click Regenerate button
  - [ ] Click "Same Prompt" without changes
  - [ ] Verify 1 credit deducted
  - [ ] Verify new PDF generated
  - [ ] Verify navigation works

- [ ] **Edit with New Instructions**
  - [ ] Open existing PDF
  - [ ] Click Regenerate
  - [ ] Add new prompt text
  - [ ] Click "With New Content"
  - [ ] Verify 0.5 credits deducted
  - [ ] Verify edits applied to PDF

- [ ] **Image Upload**
  - [ ] Click Regenerate
  - [ ] Drag and drop image
  - [ ] Verify preview appears
  - [ ] Remove and re-add image
  - [ ] Submit regeneration
  - [ ] Verify image included in PDF

- [ ] **Insufficient Credits**
  - [ ] Use account with 0 credits
  - [ ] Click Regenerate
  - [ ] Verify buttons disabled
  - [ ] Verify warning message
  - [ ] Check upgrade prompt

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Try invalid file type
  - [ ] Try file over 8MB
  - [ ] Submit empty form
  - [ ] Test network failure
  - [ ] Verify error messages

### Browser Testing

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

### Subscription Tier Testing

- [ ] Starter tier (5 PDFs/month)
- [ ] Professional tier (50 PDFs/month)
- [ ] Business tier (200 PDFs/month)
- [ ] Enterprise tier (unlimited)

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations

- Single image upload per regeneration (by design)
- Images stored in temp directory (not persistent storage)
- No version history UI (data is tracked in DB)
- No side-by-side comparison view
- Credit fractions may accumulate (0.5 + 0.5 = 1)

### Future Improvements

- Multiple image upload support
- Persistent image storage (UploadThing integration)
- Version history viewer
- Batch regeneration
- AI-suggested edits
- Cost estimation before regeneration

## üìä Metrics to Track

### Usage Metrics

- Total regenerations per day/week/month
- Same Prompt vs Edit mode distribution
- Average edits per PDF
- Image upload frequency
- Credit consumption rate

### Performance Metrics

- Modal open time
- API response time
- Image upload speed
- Regeneration completion time
- Error rate

### Business Metrics

- Credit usage patterns
- Upgrade conversion from quota warnings
- User satisfaction with regeneration
- Feature adoption rate

## üîí Security Audit

### Completed Security Measures

- [x] Authentication required (Clerk)
- [x] User ownership validation
- [x] Quota enforcement
- [x] File type validation (PNG/JPEG only)
- [x] File size limits (8MB max)
- [x] SQL injection prevention (Drizzle ORM)
- [x] XSS protection (Next.js built-in)
- [x] Rate limiting consideration (via quota)

### Security Best Practices Applied

- [x] Server-side validation for all inputs
- [x] Sanitized file names
- [x] Temp storage cleanup
- [x] Credit verification before processing
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
